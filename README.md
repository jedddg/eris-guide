Holding your hand throughout the Eris experience.

## Information

As there is no extra resources for Eris, I have decided to make an Eris guide as I am starting to dislike Discord.js and some of its recent approaches.

This guide aims to close the learning gap for new users who are new coming in to using Eris.

Before starting this guide, make sure you have a basic understanding of JavaScript.
