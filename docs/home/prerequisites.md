## Installing Node.js

If you haven't already, make sure to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

Eris requires a minimun of Node.js version 10.4.0 and higher, but its recommended you install the Long Term Support (LTS) version for the best stability.

## Installing a code editor

A code editor is a type of application that can write, debug, and run code, with extra tools to help enhance your experience.

It is highly suggested you install a code editor, rather then using NotePad or Notepad++!

Some good examples are:

 * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
 * [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
 * [Atom](https://atom.io/)
