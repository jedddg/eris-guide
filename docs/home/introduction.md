# Introduction

Discord.js isn't for you but you are finding it hard to learn Eris? This guide is meant to help newcomers who are interested in Eris.

Before starting this guide, make sure you have a basic understanding of JavaScript.

Need to learn JavaScript? Check these out:

-   [JavaScript Documentation, MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
-   [CodeAcademy's JavaScript guide](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
-   [W3Schools' JavaScript guide](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
-   [WornOffKeys' JavaScript guide](https://courses.wornoffkeys.com/jscourse)

You should also get comfortable with reading documentation from [Eris' official documentation](https://abal.moe/Eris/docs/), as it will help you get around how the wrapper works and is used. This guide will **not** cover the depths of this package - just the basics.

If you would like to suggest other things explained on this website, make an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/jedddg/eris-guide/issues).

Without further ado, let's get started.
